# STEM-Surge-7.0

Simply put... A few intelligent servers manage a dynamic array of workers that can perform any task on demand in a massively multi-threaded environment.

STEM Management created Surge in 2009 seeking to solve common issues encountered in datacenters managing big data flows. Surge is an extendable platform designed to grow; it is intended to be customized for each customer given their enterprise specific goals.

The website (www.stemmanagement.com) has installers and more information.

The code released here is running in production environments; it can be used directly, and serve as a set of examples on how developers might create their own extensions to the platform.
